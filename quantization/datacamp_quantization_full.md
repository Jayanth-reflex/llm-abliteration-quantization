## 1. Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI systems with billions of parameters. Their size and complexity make them resource-intensive to train, deploy, and use. Quantization is a key technique to make LLMs more accessible and efficient.

---

## 2. The Scale and Complexity of LLMs
- LLMs like GPT-4 have up to 175 billion parameters.
- Larger models require more memory, storage, and computational power.
- **Bar Graph Example:**

## 3. The Cost of Running LLMs and Quantization
- Running LLMs is expensive due to hardware (GPUs, accelerators) and energy costs.
- Quantization reduces these costs by lowering memory and compute requirements.
- Enables on-premises and edge deployments.

---

## 4. What is Quantization?
- Quantization reduces the numerical precision of model parameters (e.g., from 32-bit floats to 8-bit or 4-bit integers).
- This is like compressing a high-res image to a lower resolution: smaller size, but key features are preserved.
- Allows LLMs to run on less powerful hardware with minimal performance loss.

---

## 5. Basics of Quantization
- Neural networks use high-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., float32) for weights and activations.
- Quantization converts these to lower-precision formats (e.g., int8, int4), reducing memory and speeding up computation.
- **Diagram Example:**

## 6. Types of Quantization
### Static Quantization
- Applied during training; weights and activations are quantized and fixed for all layers.
- Pros: Predictable memory use, good for edge devices.
- Cons: Less adaptable to varying input patterns.

### Dynamic Quantization
- Weights are quantized ahead of time; activations are quantized dynamically during inference.
- Pros: Balances compression and runtime efficiency.
- Cons: Slightly more computational overhead.

### Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
- Quantization is applied after training, often without retraining.
- Pros: Fast, reduces model size, improves inference speed.
- Cons: May reduce accuracy, needs calibration.

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
- Model is trained with quantization in mind, learning to handle quantization errors.
- Pros: Preserves accuracy, robust to low precision.
- Cons: Requires retraining, more compute during training.

### Binary/Ternary Quantization
- Weights are quantized to two (binary: -1, 1) or three (ternary: -1, 0, 1) values.
- Pros: Maximum compression and speed.
- Cons: Significant accuracy loss, not suitable for all tasks.

## 7. Benefits & Challenges of Quantization
### Benefits
- Reduces memory and storage requirements.
- Enables LLMs on edge devices and consumer hardware.
- Improves inference speed and energy efficiency.

### Challenges
- Can introduce accuracy loss (quantization error).
- Requires careful calibration and sometimes retraining.
- Not all models or tasks are equally robust to quantization.
