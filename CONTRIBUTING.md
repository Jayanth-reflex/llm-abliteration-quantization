## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### 1. Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use Black formatter
- **Type Hints**: Required for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
- **Comments**: Explain complex algorithms and research concepts

```python
def quantize_model(
    model: nn.Module,
    method: str,
    bits: int = 4,
    calibration_data: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> Tuple[nn.Module, Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Quantize a language model using specified method.
    
    Args:
        model: The model to quantize
        method: Quantization method ('gptq', 'awq', 'qlora')
        bits: Number of quantization bits
        calibration_data: Optional calibration dataset
    
    Returns:
        Tuple of (quantized_model, metrics)
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If method is not supported
        
    Example:
        >>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
        >>> quantized, metrics = quantize_model(model, "qlora", bits=4)
    """
```

#### 2. Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All new functions must have unit tests

```python
# tests/test_quantization.py
import pytest
from llm_toolkit.quantization import QuantizationCLI

class TestQuantizationCLI:
    def test_qlora_quantization(self):
        """Test QLoRA quantization functionality."""
        cli = QuantizationCLI()
        # Test implementation
        
    @pytest.mark.gpu
    def test_gpu_quantization(self):
