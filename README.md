## üìö Learning Path: Beginner to Advanced

### 1. **Start Here: Key Concepts**
- **What are LLMs?**
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained to understand and generate human language.
- **Why Uncensor or Quantize?**
  - Uncensoring (abliteration) helps researchers study model behavior without safety filters.
  - Quantization makes big models usable on regular hardware.
