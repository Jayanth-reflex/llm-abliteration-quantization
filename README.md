## üìö Learning Path: Beginner to Advanced

### 1. **Abliteration (Uncensoring LLMs)**
- **Goal:** Remove refusal behaviors from LLMs for research and interpretability.
- **Get Started:**
  - [Abliteration Guide & Scripts](./abliteration/README.md)

### 2. **Quantization (Efficient LLMs)**
- **Goal:** Run and fine-tune large models on limited hardware using fewer bits.
- **Unified Reference:**
  - [Quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs): Beginner to Advanced](./quantization/quantization_all_levels.md)
  - This guide integrates the latest research (including QLoRA) and is suitable for all users.
