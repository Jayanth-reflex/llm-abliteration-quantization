## üîß **Technical Questions**

### **Q: What's the difference between quantization methods?**
**A:** Here's a quick comparison:

| Method | Memory Reduction | Speed | Quality | Best For |
|--------|------------------|-------|---------|----------|
| **QLoRA** | 4x | 3x | 95% | Fine-tuning, general use |
| **GPTQ** | 4x | 3x | 97% | Post-training, production |
| **AWQ** | 4x | 3x | 98% | Activation-aware optimization |
| **BitNet** | 10x | 8x | 96% | Extreme compression (2024) |

### **Q: Will quantization hurt my model's performance?**
**A:** Modern quantization methods preserve 95-98% of original performance:
- **4-bit quantization**: Typically 2-5% quality loss
- **8-bit quantization**: Usually <2% quality loss
- **Smart techniques**: QLoRA, AWQ minimize quality impact
- **Trade-off**: Slight quality loss for major efficiency gains

### **Q: Can I quantize any model?**
**A:** Most modern LLMs support quantization:
- ‚úÖ **Supported**: GPT, LLaMA, Mistral, CodeLlama, Vicuna
- ‚úÖ **Multi-modal**: CLIP, LLaVA, BLIP-2
- ‚úÖ **Custom models**: Most transformer architectures
- ‚ùå **Limited**: Very old models, non-transformer architectures

### **Q: What about abliteration - is it safe?**
**A:** Abliteration should be used responsibly:
- ‚úÖ **Research purposes**: Understanding model behavior
- ‚úÖ **Red-teaming**: Security testing and auditing
- ‚úÖ **Controlled environments**: Internal testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production use**: Consider ethical implications
- ‚ùå **Harmful content**: Don't enable dangerous outputs

# Or use our quick start
cd practical_projects/level_1_beginner/smart_chatbot
python quick_start.py
```

### **Q: I'm getting CUDA out of memory errors. Help!**
**A:** Common solutions:
1. **Reduce batch size**: Use `batch_size=1`
2. **Enable CPU offloading**: Use `device_map="auto"`
3. **Use smaller model**: Try "small" instead of "large" variants
4. **More aggressive quantization**: Use 4-bit instead of 8-bit
